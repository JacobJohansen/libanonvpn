        <p>Hosting AnonVPN for yourself is a great way to connect to private
        services on your own network, or to protect your traffic while
        travelling by routing it to a trusted computer on a trusted network
        before a malicious wi-fi access point can be used to attack the
        traffic. Tampered traffic will simply be rejected by the VPN, and most
        forms of tampering will be impossible anyway.</p>

        <p>While you should always use the <a href="https://torproject.org">Tor
        Browser Bundle</a> for the maximum level of anonymity when browsing the
        web, AnonVPN is itself a powerful device for circumventing censorship
        and protecting yourself from many meaningful classes of attacker.
        Providing this as a service to people who need it is a good we
        encourage. If one wishes, one may combine these authentication types on
        the same service as a financial-auth service, possibly as a form of
        donation-collecting.</p>

          Password-based account generation, account-based authentication</h3>
          <p>There are two “Flavors” of password-based authentication. In
          “Simple” mode, the software generates a password for you, which you
          share with one person. When that person connects, it generates a new
          password and shows it to the systems administrator to give to the
          next person. A list of base64 addresses authorized in this way, the
          now-useless password they created their account with, and the time of
          their account creation may be recorded for administrative purposes
          such as revoking keys that are compromised. This does not scale well,
          but it’s hopefully very easy to understand and set up, and very hard
          to do unsafely, and may be appealing to human-rights organizations
          with non-technical members.</p>
          <p>In “Normal” mode passwords are long-term and part of a
          username-password pair. A user with a password may use it to
          authorize multiple Base64 Addresses for his that user account. This
          is more flexible, but in this case passwords are sensitive and thus
          they are stored encrypted at all times, and revocation of keys may
          need to also include revocation of passwords. This mode may be
          appealing to a wide span of users.</p>
