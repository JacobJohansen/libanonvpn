      <p>Where we do better: We have a no-logging policy, but even if we did
      log, we would have great difficulty linking activity with a single,
      real-world individual. All of our multi-hopping privacy benefits also
      apply to peer-to-peer software as well, so we cannot provide useful
      information about your peer-to-peer software use, especially if it is
      end-to-end encrypted like most peer-to-peer software is. We eliminate the
      complexity of other VPN software and use encryption provided by the I2P
      network, and establish our communication directly over I2P. I2P addresses
      cannot be impersonated and I2P connections are always end-to-end
      encrypted and multihopped. Finally, not only are our servers obfuscated,
      we also obfuscate the connection itself and ISP-level attackers will only
      see the first hop over the I2P network, and not the actual server.</p>
      <p>Where they do better: Because there currently is not an I2P router
      available for iOS without jailbreaking, we cannot be compatible with iOS
      yet. We will eventually solve this problem.</p>
