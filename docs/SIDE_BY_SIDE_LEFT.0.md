Security Features and Add-Ons
-----------------------------

  - Windows, Mac, **iOS**, Android, Linux, Router compatibility
  - Kill Switches
  - DNS Leak Protection
  - *No-Logging Policy*
  - *Torrenting and P2P*
  - *OpenVPN, IKEv2, IPSec and PPTP protocol*
  - *Up to 256-Bit AES encryption*
  - *Browser Extensions*
  - *Obfuscated Servers*

Where we do better: We have a no-logging policy, but even if we did log, we
would have great difficulty linking activity with a single, real-world
individual. All of our multi-hopping privacy benefits also apply to peer-to-peer
software as well, so we cannot provide useful information about your
peer-to-peer software use, especially if it is end-to-end encrypted like most
peer-to-peer software is. We eliminate the complexity of other VPN software and
use encryption provided by the I2P network, and establish our communication
directly over I2P. I2P addresses cannot be impersonated and I2P connections are
always end-to-end encrypted and multihopped. Finally, not only are our servers
obfuscated, we also obfuscate the connection itself and ISP-level attackers will
only see the first hop over the I2P network, and not the actual server.

Where they do better: Because there currently is not an I2P router available for iOS
without jailbreaking, we cannot be compatible with iOS yet. We will eventually
solve this problem.
