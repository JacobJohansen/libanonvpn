      ISP</h2>
      <div class="content isp hiddenservice">
        <p>Like all VPN’s, we encrypt traffic between your VPN client and our
        VPN servers, but in most VPN’s, if the ISP knows where the server is,
        then they can tell that you are connecting to the VPN. With our VPN,
        the ISP will only see the middle hop, one of tens-of-thousands of
        possible computers around the world, and not the true VPN service IP
        address.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content isp resistant">
        <p>In addition to that, we use the I2P network to transport your
        communication, and in doing so, we inherit the I2P network’s
        Censorship-Resistance properties. The communication itself will be
        obfuscated and “Unclassifiable” to known Deep-Packet Inspection
        devices, and connections will be made using peers in the I2P network
        which, once bootstrapped, is self-sustaining.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content isp unblockable">
        <p>As a result of all this, it is very unlikely that your ISP will even
        be able to tell that you are using our VPN.</p>

      <h2 id="we-protect-you-against-us">We Protect You Against Us</h2>
      <div class="content vpn minimize">
        <p>All other commercial VPN’s require you to trust that the VPN
        provider will not undermine the security of your connection, share your
        account information, or be subverted by attack. We take steps to
        minimize what account information we can possibly collect by
        anonymously routing your connection to and from our servers.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content vpn anonymous">
        <p>This anonymous routing is enforced from both the client and the
        server side, with each choosing a single hop from a network with
        tens-of-thousands of nodes. Both the client and the server are only
        addressable by self-authenticating, end-to-end encrypted, and
        DPI-Unclassifiable tunnels, and never by a public IP address. As a
        result, even if we were compromised, we could not provide account
        information linking you to a real identity.</p>

        <p>Of course, just like Tor and I2P, we can only protect you with the
        software we write on the network we design. Once you exit to the
        internet, your traffic will appear to be coming from our servers, but
        you should also make sure to use HTTPS-Everywhere in your web browser,
        or use a web browser which enforces TLS usage on it’s own.</p>
