    <p>Library for providing and connecting to VPN’s over the I2P network.
    Daemon, web client, and terminal client. This is an automatically
    configuring, automatically deploying, automatically multihopping
    pseudonymous VPN.</p>

  <div class="content installsource">
    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To install the dependencies needed to build this locally run make
      dependencies’ which will install ‘nsis’, and ‘unix2dos’ utilities.</li>
      <li>You will also need a valid installation of ‘go 1.12.x’</li>
      <li>To build thd binaries run ‘make’</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="content usage example">
    <h2 id="example-usage">Example Usage</h2>
    <div class="content usage server">
      <h3 id="server-side">Server-Side</h3>
      <p>Start by creating a server configuration file like the one found in
      /etc/anonvpn/anonvpn.ini. Then run the server using that file:</p>
      <pre><code>    ./anonvpn -file server.ini</code></pre>
    </div>
    <div class="content usage.client">
      <h3 id="client-side">Client-Side</h3>
      <p>When the server is started, it will create a minimum viable
      configuration file for clients. You can run with a similar command:</p>
      <pre><code>    ./anonvpn -file client.ini</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h2 id="turn-key-privacy-advantages">Turn-Key Privacy Advantages</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Trustless Multihopping:</strong> go-anonvpn uses the I2P
      network to negotiate encrypted, peer-to-peer tunnels which are used to
      establish the VPN hops without revealing the true IP address of any
      tunnel participant to any other participant.This is in contrast to
      Wireguard, where you can multihop, but the configuration requires you to
      coordinate with multiple providers, we can simply do it
      automatically.</li>
      <li><strong>Pseudonymous Subscription:</strong> go-anonvpn integrates a
      multi-wallet which is your virtual subscription. Pay for the VPN
      as-you-go by transferring money to the VPN wallet, and use a method
      similar to electrum’s “Change” addresses to separate your payment
      identities from the rest of your crypto usage. This is so we can’t
      correlate your specifidc traffic to your payment. Also, pay as you go.
      Your subscription is the content of your wallet, never pay for more time
      than you need.</li>
      <li><strong>Resistant to Analysis:</strong> go-anonvpn inherits the
      traffic-obfuscation and encryption properties of the underlying I2P
      network, making it nearly impossible to identify and block usage of the
      VPN. With the assistance of “helper” applications, it can be impossible
      to block on even the most restricted networks.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="content others">
    <h2 id="other-advantages">Other advantages</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer:</strong> Your VPN server has one reachable
      name, and will only ever have one reachable name, which is
      cryptographically secure and addressable within the I2P network only. No
      one can ever impersonate your server unless they steal your private
      keys.</li>
      <li><strong>Self-Hosting:</strong> A VPN Service can be hosted by anyone,
      anywhere, while maintaining a trust-less system, either gratis as one may
      in the interest of the public good or as a participant in a
      de-centralized VPN marketplace where servers can set their own prices
      based on the features and bandwidth or anonymity features they can
      provide.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="content planned">
    <h3 id="planned-advantages">Planned Advantages</h3>
    <p><em>These features are incomplete and non-operational. They will be
    moved as they</em> <em>are implemented.</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>De-Centralization:</strong> Soon, instead of subscribing to a
      fixed VPN endpoint one may query a de-centralized pool of nodes providing
      the services they require, in order to enhance their anonymity by making
      their exit to the internet difficult to predict. This pool of nodes will
      be anonymous and uncensorable.Some possible candidates for this have
      already been implemented, none decided on, most not mutually
      exclusive.</li>
      <li><strong>Server-Blinding:</strong> Server-to-Server agreements,
      financial or otherwise, may be used to further pool and obfuscate the
      origin of a connection, in order to protect server operators from
      persecution intended to target their subscribers. From the outside, it
      will be nearly impossible to determine which customer ID’s are being
      served by which server ID’s in real time or retro-actively.</li>
      <li><strong>Redistributable</strong> Since this will work best with a
      diverse userbase, we want to make it as easy as possible to share this
      application safely with a local friend. The application will be capable
      of doing things like setting up a local F-Droid or Aptly repository for
      sharing the package on a LAN, or to expose the repository as an I2P-only
      site. - <strong>Bittorrent-over-I2P based Updates:</strong> In order to
      ensure that the VPN is always up-to-date and accessible to people who
      already have it, a Bittorrent-over-I2P based updating system will be
      implemented where all participants will potentially provide updates to
      eachother from multiple anonymous sources.</li>
